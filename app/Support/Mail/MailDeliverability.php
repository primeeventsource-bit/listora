 * Can this application actually put a message in someone's inbox?

 * Laravel's `log` and `array` transports accept every message and report
 * success. Mail::to(...)->send(...) returns normally, Password::sendResetLink()
 * returns RESET_LINK_SENT, and the user is told their reset link has been sent.
 * Nothing was sent. The failure is completely silent and looks identical to
 * success from every layer above it.
 *
 * That is how this site ran: MAIL_MAILER was unset on every Laravel Cloud
 * environment, so it fell through to the 'log' default and password reset was
 * impossible for every account while the UI claimed otherwise.
 *
 * Locally that behaviour is desirable — you do not want a dev machine emailing
 * real users. So the question is not "is the mailer log?" but "is the mailer
 * log somewhere it has no business being?".
