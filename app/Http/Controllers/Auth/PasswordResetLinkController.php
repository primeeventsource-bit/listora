     * Handle an incoming password reset link request.
     *
     * Three things the stock Breeze version got wrong, all of which mattered
     * here because mail was silently disabled in production for months:
     *
     * 1. It reported success when no mail could be sent. Password::sendResetLink
     *    returns RESET_LINK_SENT for the `log` transport, so the page said
     *    "we have emailed your password reset link" to every user while the
     *    link went to a log file. Telling someone to check an inbox that will
     *    never receive anything is worse than an error — they wait, retry, and
     *    conclude their account is broken.
     *
     * 2. It let transport failures escape as a 500. Wrong SMTP credentials
     *    throw at send time, and the user got a white error page with no idea
     *    whether to try again.
     *
     * 3. It answered differently for known and unknown addresses, which turns
     *    the form into an account-enumeration oracle: submit an address, learn
     *    from the response whether it has an account here. Now every outcome
     *    that is not an outage produces the same neutral confirmation.
     *
     * @throws ValidationException
