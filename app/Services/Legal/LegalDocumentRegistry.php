/**
 * Source of truth for the four legal documents Listora publishes.
 *
 * Each document maps to:
 *   - kind          → enum value used on terms_versions.kind
 *   - view          → the Blade template the public legal page renders
 *   - route         → named route the URL is generated from (resolves to public_url())
 *   - version_label → human-readable label baked into the rendered HTML
 *
 * The registry's job is to:
 *   1. Resolve the *canonical text* of each document — the rendered <main>
 *      region, not the source Blade and not the whole page. What users read
 *      is what gets hashed; the surrounding chrome (CSRF token, absolute
 *      URLs) is excluded because it varies by environment and session
 *      without the agreement changing. See canonicalText().
 *   2. Idempotently materialise terms_versions rows via TermsVersion::forContent
 *      so the deploy seeder is safe to re-run on every push.
 *   3. Tell callers which versions are "current" for each kind, used by the
 *      register form, the EnsureCurrentTermsAccepted middleware, and the
 *      JSON versions endpoint.
 *
 * When counsel hands over the binding text, the placeholder Blade content is
 * replaced; the next deploy materialises a *new* TermsVersion row (different
 * SHA-256), and existing users will be required to re-accept.

            // confirming a booking" — describing a reservation flow Listora
            // does not operate. Replaced with Offers and Direct Arrangements,

            // a recurring monthly host subscription, and a one-time fee for a
